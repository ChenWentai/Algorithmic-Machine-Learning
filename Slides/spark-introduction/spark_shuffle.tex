		\item Storage of ``intermediate'' results on the local file-system
		\item Partitioning of ``intermediate'' data
		\item Serialization / De-serialization
		\item Pulling data over the network

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Assume: $m$ map tasks and $r$ reduce tasks
		\item Then: $m \times r$ shuffle files as well as in-memory buffers (for batching writes)
	\end{itemize}

	\item {\bf Be careful on storage space requirements!}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Buffer size must not be too big with many tasks
		\item Buffer size must not be too small, for otherwise throughput decreases

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Addresses buffer size problems}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Executor view vs. Task view
		\item Buckets are consolidated in a single file
		\item Hence: $F = C \times r$ files and buffers, where $C$ is the number of Task threads within an Executor

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Implements the Hadoop Shuffle mechanism}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Single shuffle file, plus an index file to find ``buckets''
		\item Very beneficial for write throughput, as more disk writes can be batched
	\end{itemize}

	\item {\bf Sorting mechanism}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pluggable external sorter
		\item Degenerates to Hash Shuffle if no sorting is required
