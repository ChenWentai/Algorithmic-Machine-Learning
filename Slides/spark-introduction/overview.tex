  \item {\bf Project goals}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Generality: diverse workloads, operators, job sizes
    \item Low latency: sub-second
    \item Fault tolerance: faults are the norm, not the exception
    \item Simplicity: often comes from generality
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frame {\frametitle{Motivations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf System/Framework point of view}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Unified pipeline
    \item Simplified data flow
    \item Faster processing speed
  \end{itemize}

\vspace{20pt}

  \item {\bf Data abstraction point of view}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item New fundamental abstraction RDD
    \item Easy to extend with new operators
    \item More descriptive computing model
  \end{itemize}
