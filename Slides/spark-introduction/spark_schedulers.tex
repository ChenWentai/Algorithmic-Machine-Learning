		\item Failed stages will be resubmitted

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Set of \emph{independent} tasks
		\item All tasks of a stage apply the same function
		\item All tasks of a stage have the same dependency type
		\item All tasks in a stage belong to a \texttt{TaskSet}

	\item {\bf Stage types}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Shuffle Map Stage: stage tasks results are inputs for another stage
		\item Result Stage: tasks compute the final action that initiated a job (e.g., \texttt{count()}, \texttt{save()}, etc.)

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Keeps track of each task status
			\item Retries failed tasks
			\item Imposes data locality using \emph{delayed scheduling}
