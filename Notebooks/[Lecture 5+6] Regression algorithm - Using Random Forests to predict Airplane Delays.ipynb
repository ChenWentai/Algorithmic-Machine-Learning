Decision trees and Random Forests: Simple but Powerful Algorithms\n", "> Prediction is very difficult, especially if it\u2019s about the future. (Niels Bohr)\n", "\n", "Decision trees are a very popular approach to prediction problems. Decision trees can be trained from both categorical and numerical features, to perform classification and regression. Classification and regression are the oldest and most well-studied types of predictive analytics. In many analytics packages and libraries, most algorithms are devoted either to address classification or regression problems, and they include for example support vector machines (SVM), neural networks, na\u00efve Bayes, logistic regression, and deep learning...\n", "\n", "In general, classification refers to the problem of predicting a label, or category, like *spam/not spam*, *rainy/sunny/mild*, for some given data. Regression refers to predicting a numeric quantity like salary, temperature, delay time, product's price. Both classification and regression involve predicting one (or more) values given one (or more) other input values. They require labelled data to perform a training phase, which builds the statistical model: they belong to *supervised learning* techniques.\n", "\n", "## 1.1 Feature definition\n", "To understand how regression and classification operate, it is necessary to briefly define the terms that describe their input and output. \n", "\n", "Assume that we want to predict the temperature of tomorrow given today's weather information.\n", "The weather information is a loose concept. For example, we can use many variables to express today's weather such as:\n", "* the average humidity today\n", "* today\u2019s high temperature\n", "* today\u2019s low temperature \n", "* wind speed\n", "* outlook: e.g. cloudy, rainy, or clear\n", "* ....\n", "\n", "These variables are called *features* or *demensions*. \n", "\n", "Each variable can be quantified. For example, high and low temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius, humidity can be measured as a fraction between 0 and 1, and weather type can be labeled `cloudy`, `rainy` or `clear`...\n", "So, the weather today can be expressed by a list of values: `11.4, 18.0, 0.64, 20, cloudy`\n", "Each feature is also called a `predictor`. Together, they constitute a `feature vector`.\n", "\n", "A feature whose domain is a set of categories is called **categorical feature**. In our example, `outlook` is a  categorical feature. A feature whose values are numerical is called **numerical feature**. In our example, `temperature` is a numerical feature.\n", "\n", "Finally, tomorrow's temperature, that is what we want to predict, is called *target feature*.\n", "\n", "## 1.2 Decision Trees & Random Forests\n", "The first question that you might ask is: \"Why Decision trees and not another approach?\"\n", "\n", "Well, the literature shows that the family of algorithms known as decision trees can naturally handle both categorical and numeric features. The training process is easy to understand. The model is easy to interpret. They are robust to outliers in the data, meaning that a few extreme and possibly erroneous data points should not affect the tree at all. The model can be trained in parallel easily. The accuracy is comparable to other methods... In short, there are lots of advantages when using decision trees with respect to other methods! \n", "\n", "The way we use a tree model is very simple to understand. We can say that this process \"mimics\" the way humans take decisions. For example, to decide whether to play football or not, a natural questions would be \"does it rain now ?\". If yes, the decision is `no`. If it's sunny, the condition is favorable to play football. A second natural question could be: \"is it windy?\". If no, then you may want to stay at home because otherwise it is going to be too hot. Otherwise, a third plausible question could be: \"do we have enough people?\". If no, then there's no point playing. Otherwise, time to play!\n", "\n", "Using a decision tree allows to follow a similar process to that described above (see the image below). Given a new input, the algorithm traverses the tree in a such a way that the input satisfies the condition of each node until reaching a leaf one. The value of the leaf node is the decision.\n", "\n", "![A decision tree](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1690/24308350756_8533286fb5_z.jpg)\n", "\n", "The tree model in the figure is built from historical information concerning many past days.

In other words, the model is too fit to the training data, it is too precise and not general enough. So, when testing the quality of predictions with different testing sets, accuracy could fluctuate. To overcome this limitation, the tree can be pruned after it is built, or even be pruned during the training process. Another approach is building a `Random Decision Forest`.\n", "\n", "A `Random Decision Forest`, as its name implies, is a forest of random Decision trees.
